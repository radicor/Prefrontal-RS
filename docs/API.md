# Prefrontal-RS — API reference

Everything the dashboard does goes through this surface, so everything the
dashboard does, your code can do too. Four ways in:

| Surface | Transport | For |
|---|---|---|
| REST + WebSocket | `http://127.0.0.1:7320` | apps, scripts, the web UI |
| `prefrontal-client` | Rust crate | Rust programs (thin wrapper over REST/WS) |
| `prefrontal` CLI | terminal | humans in a shell |
| `prefrontal mcp` | MCP stdio | AI agents |

All types below live in the `prefrontal-protocol` crate — every surface
serializes/deserializes the same structs.

## The origin boundary — read this before binding anywhere but loopback

The daemon has **no authentication**. Its whole security posture is "the
caller is the local user", which stops being true the moment a web page is
open, so the daemon re-establishes it per request:

| Check | Rule |
|---|---|
| `Host` | Must be the configured bind address (plus `localhost`/`::1`/`0.0.0.0`). Anything else is `403`. Kills DNS rebinding. |
| `Sec-Fetch-Site` | On `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` must be `same-origin` or `none`. `cross-site`/`same-site` is `403`. |
| `Origin` | When `Sec-Fetch-Site` is absent, `Origin` must equal `http://<the request's own Host>`. A missing `Origin` is allowed — that is the CLI, MCP, and `curl`. |
| `GET /ws` | Same `Origin` rule. Browsers do not enforce same-origin on a WebSocket handshake, so without it any page could read the whole `Snapshot`. |

Every response carries `Content-Security-Policy` (`default-src 'self'`,
`script-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`),
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`,
`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`.

**`[server] bind` widens all of this.** The defaults are tuned for
`127.0.0.1`. On any other interface the daemon is an *unauthenticated*
read/write service for every project under your roots — including
`POST /api/git/<project>/commit` — reachable by anyone who can route to it.
If you need that, put it behind something that authenticates.

### Untrusted project directories

A project folder here may have been copied, synced, restored from a backup, or
unpacked from a tarball, and in every one of those cases its `.git/config`
came from someone else. Every `git` shell-out therefore passes hardening
`-c` overrides that outrank all config files: `core.fsmonitor`,
`core.attributesFile` and `credential.helper` are blanked, `core.sshCommand`
is pinned to `ssh`, `core.pager` to `cat`, and `core.hooksPath` is pinned to
the repository's own hooks directory. Without this, a `core.fsmonitor` line
turns opening the Repo tab into arbitrary command execution. Note commits
still use your identity, your global config, and your local hooks.

Rendered markdown is *sanitized*, not escaped: comrak with
`render.r#unsafe = true` piped through `ammonia::clean`, so a README's
`<div>`/`<img>` survive and its `<script>` does not. `/raw` (which serves
images a README references, `svg` included) returns
`Content-Disposition: attachment` plus `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`
so a hostile SVG can never execute at the dashboard's origin — `<img>`
renders it fine.

## REST

### `GET /api/projects` → `Project[]`

Every project, newest-touched first, served from the warm cache (the file
watcher keeps it current; no scan happens per request).

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Occipital-RS",
  "path": "/home/you/Projects/Occipital-RS",
  "languages": ["rust"],
  "activity": "active",            // active | warm | cold | parked | archived
  "git": {
    "branch": "main",
    "last_commit_unix": 1785340000,
    "dirty_files": 0,
    "commit_count": 45,
    "remote": "git@github.com:you/Occipital-RS.git",
    "ahead": 0,
    "behind": 0,
    "recent_commits": [ { "id": "9cf767e6", "summary": "…", "time_unix": 0 } ]
  },
  "tagline": "The agent's reading cortex…",
  "tags": [],
  "health": [ { "flag": "dirty_pile", "count": 44 } ],  // no_git | no_remote | never_committed | dirty_pile
  "last_touched_unix": 1785340000,
  "has_readme": true,
  "has_claude_md": true
}
```

### `POST /api/rescan` → `Project[]`

Full rescan now; also broadcasts a merged `snapshot` to every WS client.
The escape hatch — normally the watcher makes this unnecessary.

Three deliberate behaviours:

- **A failed scan keeps the last good state.** A panic anywhere in the scan
  answers `500` and leaves the cached project list alone; it never blanks the
  dashboard.
- **Results merge, they do not replace.** A project the watcher touched while
  the walk was running keeps its newer data, so a commit made mid-rescan does
  not disappear from the counts until the next filesystem event.
- **Throttled and de-duplicated.** A scan started less than 5 s after the
  last one, or while one is still running, returns the current list without
  starting another walk. Two overlapping scans can never resolve out of
  order.

### `GET /api/health` → daemon health

The "is it actually live?" answer the connection dot could not give.
`watch.failed_dirs > 0` means some directories are not being watched at all
(inotify limits) and those projects are static until a rescan;
`index_ok: false` means the search index was rebuilt and is being refilled.
The dashboard shows both in its footer.

```jsonc
{
  "ok": true,
  "projects": 47,
  "watch": { "watched_dirs": 4312, "failed_dirs": 0 },
  "index_ok": true,
  "last_scan": { "last_scan_unix": 1785340000, "last_scan_failed": false,
                 "watched_dirs": 4312, "failed_dirs": 0 }
}
```

### `GET /api/colony` → `ColonyStatus`

The -RS colony as seen from this machine: which siblings are installed
(source checkout, binary in a known dir, or answering a port — independent
ORs), which are live right now, and how to reach each. Probes touch loopback
only; the daemon re-sweeps every 15 s (configurable) and this endpoint serves
the cached result. `503` when `colony.enabled = false`.

```jsonc
{
  "siblings": [{
    "name": "ApexRouter-RS",
    "tagline": "OpenAI-compatible model router",
    "surface": "web_ui",              // web_ui | http_api | mcp | cli | native | no_runtime
    "port": 8888,
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/",  // only for web_ui siblings
    "mcp": null,                      // MCP server name, when it speaks MCP
    "checkout": null,                 // path under a scan root, if checked out
    "binary": "/home/you/.local/bin/apexrouter",
    "live": true,                     // null = no port to probe
    "lander": "https://apexaurum.no/ApexRouter/"
  }],
  "checked_unix": 1785792887
}
```

"Installed" is derived: `checkout || binary || live == true` — a sibling can
be live with no checkout (binary installs) or checked out and dormant.

### `GET /api/search?q=<query>&limit=<n>` → `SearchHit[]`

Full-text over code, docs, commit messages, **and symbol cards** (one tiny
document per `fn`/`struct`/`class`/`def` declaration). `limit` caps at 100,
default 30.

```jsonc
{
  "project": "Prefrontal-RS",
  "path": "prefrontald/src/watch.rs",  // file path, or short commit id for kind=commit
  "kind": "symbol",                    // code | doc | commit | symbol
  "line": 110,                         // 1-based; null for commits
  "snippet": "async fn debounce_loop(",
  "score": 14.2
}
```

### `GET /api/cortex?q=<query>` → `CortexHit[]`

Semantic recall through the optional CerebroCortex layer. `503` when
`features.cerebro` is off — treat that as "feature absent", not an error.

### `POST /api/cortex/sync` → `{ created, updated }`

Upsert one semantic summary per project into the cortex (tag-deduped:
`prefrontal` + `project:<name>`).

### Docs & notes

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/docs/{project}` | `DocEntry[]` — md/markdown/txt files, README first |
| `GET /api/doc/{project}/{path}` | `DocContent` — `raw` + sanitized `html` |
| `PUT /api/doc/{project}/{path}` body `{"content": "…"}` | `DocWriteResult` |
| `GET /raw/{project}/{path}` | image bytes (doc-referenced assets) |

Writes auto-commit **that file only** (`git commit -- <path>`, message
`[prefrontal] note: <path>`) and never push. `DocWriteResult` reports honestly:

```jsonc
{ "saved": true, "committed": false, "commit_id": null, "detail": "not a git repository" }
```

Path rules (all doc/raw routes): relative, no `..`, extension allow-listed,
symlink-escape checked. Projects are addressed by name and resolved only
through the daemon's own scan — clients never send filesystem paths.

### Working tree (phase 7)

Local git. Reads never leave the machine. Writes are allowlisted porcelain
(stage / unstage / commit / switch / stash). **Push and Fetch** refuse unless
`[git] allow_push = true`. Never `--force`. CLI/MCP expose **reads only**.

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/git/{project}/status` | `GitStatus` — paths, staged/unstaged/untracked, ahead/behind, stashes, `allow_push` |
| `GET /api/git/{project}/diff?path=&cached=&rev=` | `GitDiff` — unified patch, size-capped |
| `GET /api/git/{project}/log?limit=&skip=` | `CommitSummary[]` |
| `GET /api/git/{project}/commit/{id}` | `GitCommitDetail` — author, body, files |
| `GET /api/git/{project}/refs` | `GitRef[]` — local / remote / tag |
| `GET /api/git/{project}/tree?rev=&path=` | `GitTreeEntry[]` |
| `GET /api/git/{project}/file?path=&rev=` | `GitFile` — `rev=WORKTREE` reads the disk |
| `POST /api/git/{project}/stage` body `{"paths":[…]}` | `GitOpResult` |
| `POST /api/git/{project}/unstage` body `{"paths":[…]}` | `GitOpResult` |
| `POST /api/git/{project}/commit` body `{"message":"…","paths":[…]?}` | `GitOpResult` |
| `POST /api/git/{project}/switch` body `{"name":"…","create":false}` | `GitOpResult` |
| `POST /api/git/{project}/stash` body `{"action":"push"|"pop","message":?}` | `GitOpResult` |
| `POST /api/git/{project}/push` | `GitOpResult` — gated by `allow_push` |
| `POST /api/git/{project}/fetch` | `GitOpResult` — same gate |

Git pathspecs: relative, no `..`, no magic `:(` / `:!` / globs. Never `git add -A`.

---

## WebSocket — `GET /ws`

JSON frames, tagged by `type`:

| Frame | When |
|---|---|
| `{"type":"snapshot","projects":[…]}` | on connect, and after `/api/rescan` |
| `{"type":"project_changed","project":{…}}` | a project's visible state changed on disk |
| `{"type":"project_removed","path":"…"}` | a project directory disappeared |
| `{"type":"colony","colony":{…}}` | on connect (after the snapshot), and when a sibling's state changed |

Deltas are debounced (~600 ms of quiet per project) and suppressed when a
rescan changes nothing the dashboard shows; colony sweeps that change nothing
are suppressed the same way. On reconnect, the fresh snapshot (+ colony
frame) covers anything missed — clients never need replay logic.

---

## Rust SDK — `prefrontal-client`

```rust
let pf = prefrontal_client::Prefrontal::default();      // 127.0.0.1:7320
let projects = pf.projects().await?;
let hits = pf.search("resample", 10).await?;
let doc = pf.read_doc("Prefrontal-RS", "docs/CHARTER.md").await?;
pf.write_doc("my-project", "notes/idea.md", "# it begins").await?;  // auto-commits

let mut events = std::pin::pin!(pf.events().await?);    // live deltas
while let Some(ev) = events.next().await { /* … */ }
```

See `prefrontal-client/examples/watch.rs`.

---

## MCP — `prefrontal mcp`

Stdio server, newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, daemon-independent (tools scan
directly, cached 10 s). Register:

```sh
claude mcp add prefrontal -- /path/to/prefrontal mcp
```

| Tool | Args | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `list_projects` | — | every project, compact JSON |
| `project_status` | `project` | full detail incl. recent commits |
| `where_was_i` | `days?` (14) | commit timeline, newest first |
| `search` | `query`, `limit?` (20) | `SearchHit[]` |
| `list_docs` | `project` | doc paths |
| `read_doc` | `project`, `path` | raw markdown |
| `write_doc` | `project`, `path`, `content` | write + local auto-commit result |
| `colony_status` | — | -RS siblings: installed / live / how to reach |
| `git_status` | `project` | working-tree paths + ahead/behind (read-only) |
| `git_diff` | `project`, `path`, `cached?`, `rev?` | unified patch |
| `git_log` | `project`, `limit?`, `skip?` | recent commits |
| `git_show` | `project`, `id` | commit detail |
| `git_tree` | `project`, `rev?`, `path?` | directory at a revision |
| `git_file` | `project`, `path`, `rev?` | file at a revision |

Tool failures come back as MCP `isError` results with a helpful message;
JSON-RPC errors are reserved for protocol breakage.

## CLI

```sh
prefrontal status [--json]   # table of everything
prefrontal health            # only flagged projects (rot check)
prefrontal timeline          # where was I, grouped by day
prefrontal find <terms…>     # full-text + symbols
prefrontal colony [--json]   # -RS siblings: installed / live / reach
prefrontal recall <words…>   # semantic (needs features.cerebro)
prefrontal cortex-sync       # upsert project summaries into the cortex
prefrontal mcp               # serve MCP on stdio
prefrontal git status <proj> # working-tree paths
prefrontal git diff <proj> <path> [--cached] [--rev]
prefrontal git log <proj>
prefrontal git show <proj> <id>
prefrontal git tree <proj> [--rev] [path]
prefrontal git file <proj> <path> [--rev]
```

The CLI scans directly — it works with the daemon stopped (search reads the
shared index, built by the daemon).

---

## Configuration

`~/.config/prefrontal/config.toml`, all fields optional — see
[`config.example.toml`](../config.example.toml) for the annotated reference.
Highlights: `roots` (scan targets), `[thresholds]` (activity + dirty-pile),
`[timeline]` (window/cap), `[overrides.<name>]` (pin status, tags, hide),
`features.cerebro` + `[cortex]` (semantic layer), `[colony]` (panel on/off,
probe interval, per-sibling port overrides — ports only; probe hosts are
hard-wired to loopback), `[git] allow_push` (Fetch/Push; default off).

The search index lives at `~/.local/share/prefrontal/index` and is a cache:
schema changes wipe and rebuild it automatically.
